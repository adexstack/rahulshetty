OAuth2
-------
>Why applications rely on Other(Google/facebook) Authentication
OAuth2  is Industry standard authentication protocol
No data breach headaches for application
Need not to maintain user profile data
Allows richer websites by allowing disparate applications to talk to each other

> grant type: Difference between Client credentials and Authorization code (Select grant type from postman header to see the mandatory queryParams)
Client credentials - Interaction Between application and resource server e.g; give me my twitter comments (only user and secret_id required),flight and hotel
Authorization code - When human authorization is involved

client
clientID - id that identify the client
clientSecretID - registers to google/facebook
ResourceOwner - human (My profile data)
Resource/Authorization Server - Google

Ultimate Plan is generate Acces Token:
User sign into Google by hitting google authorization server endpoint and get code
Application will use this code to hit google resources server in back end to get (Access token, firstName,lastName,Email)
Application grants access to user by validating Access token(which is stored in Browser)
Note: If access token expires(user will be required to re-login in)

Query Params to Get Code (Get from developers(contract)) -> Returns code
-------------
scope - needed profile info
auth_url - google
client_id - client id
response_type - code       (OTP)
redirect_uri - https://rahulshettyacademy.com/getCourse.php
state - verifyfjdss       (optional security)

Query Params to exchange code -. Returns access token
-----------------------------
code - generated code from above
client_id -
client_secret -
redirect_uri - https://rahulshettyacademy.com/getCourse.php
grant_type - authorization_code                   (client_credentials)

actual request
---------------
access-token
